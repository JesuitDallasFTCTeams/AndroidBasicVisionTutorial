# OpenCV for Basic Android Color Detection
### Computer Vision Tutorial

This program implements basic color detection using OpenCV for Android.
This program accompanies the tutorial, showing detailed instructions on how to complete the following using Android Studio:

* Download and import OpenCV into Android Studio project
* Emulate Android camera using webcam and virtual device
* Display camera feed using OpenCV library
* Process camera feed frames in real time with OpenCV
* Process color in image on touch event

###Overview
* This tutorial is designed for you to hit the ground running with your first OpenCV project for Android.

* OpenCV is an open source computer vision library that assists developers by offering a great deal of computer vision utilities including image processing, feature detection, and video analysis, as well as a machine learning library to accomplish much of our tasks.

* This tutorial is designed to act as a bridge between the "hello world" example provided by OpenCV and the sample projects provided by OpenCV. This tutorial is also meant to offer a starting point for using OpenCV with Android Studio.

* The above being said, we will touch on many of the concepts from the "hello world" example in order to get our app running from scratch in Android Studio. We will then move on to implement some basic image processing functionality, with the ultimate goal of displaying the hex code of a user-selected region of the real-time image.

* The OpenCV project that we are bridging towards is something like the color-blob-detection sample, so we will draw from this sample in part in order to show some post-hello-world steps.

* Again, we will be using Android Studio for the development of our project. Having completed one or two projects in Android Studio is probably sufficient to get through this tutorial, but some basic knowledge is presumed. I recommend you start here if you haven't built anything in Android Studio before.

* I will assume that you already have Android Studio installed, though I will run through some basics about getting a virtual Android device running on your machine that meets our needs for OpenCV.
